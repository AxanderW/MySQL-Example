-- Instruct SQL to use sakila data base --

USE sakila;

-- 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor.
SELECT 
    first_name, last_name
FROM
    actor;

-- 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.

SELECT 
    UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, ' , ', last_name)) AS 'Actor Name'
FROM
    actor;
-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, 
-- of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use
--  to obtain this information?

SELECT 
    actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    first_name = 'Joe';

-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    last_name LIKE '%GEN%';

-- 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    last_name LIKE '%LI%'
ORDER BY last_name , first_name;
-- 2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:

SELECT 
    country_id, country
FROM
    country
WHERE
    country IN ('Afghanistan' , 'Bangladesh', 'China');
-- 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create 
-- a column in the table actor named description and use the data type BLOB (Make sure to research the type BLOB, as the difference 
-- between it and VARCHAR are significant).

ALTER TABLE actor
	ADD description BLOB;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor;

-- 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much
-- effort. Delete the description column.

ALTER TABLE actor
	DROP COLUMN description;
    
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor;

-- 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.

SELECT 
    last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS 'Count of Last Name'
FROM
    actor
GROUP BY last_name;

-- 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors

SELECT 
    last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS 'Count of Last Name'
FROM
    actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(last_name) >= 2;



-- 4c. The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS. Write a query to fix the record.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    first_name = 'GROUCHO'
        AND last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

-- next update table to make correction -- 

UPDATE actor 
SET 
    first_name = 'HARPO'
WHERE
    actor_id = 172;

-- Verify Results -- 

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    actor_id = 172;

-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the 
-- first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    first_name = 'HARPO';

-- Now perform single query update --

UPDATE actor 
SET 
    first_name = 'GROUCHO'
WHERE
    actor_id = 172;

-- verify results -- 

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    actor
WHERE
    actor_id = 172; 

-- 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. 
-- Which query would you use to re-create it?

SHOW CREATE TABLE address;

-- 6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well
-- as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:

SELECT 
    staff.first_name, staff.last_name, address.address
FROM
    staff
        LEFT JOIN
    address USING (address_id);

-- 6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. 
-- Use tables staff and payment.

SELECT 
    staff.first_name,
    staff.last_name,
    SUM(payment.amount) AS 'Sum of Payment',
    payment.payment_date
FROM
    staff
        JOIN
    payment USING (staff_id)
WHERE
    payment_date BETWEEN '2005-08-01 00:00:00' AND '2005-08-31 00:00:00';

-- 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film.
--  Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

-- 6d. How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory system?

-- 6e. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
